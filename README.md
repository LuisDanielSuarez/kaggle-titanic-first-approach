# kaggle-titanic-first-approach

This is my first attempt at predicting who survives the sink of the Titanic in the famous Kaggle competition.

This notebook is a bit of a playground to practice Python coding and skills learnt from Kaggle's courses and some other courses and readings I've taken in the last couple of years, so do expect a couple of seemengly inconsequential code bloks â€”specially in the data exploration section.

You can access the original notebook from [Kaggle's website](https://www.kaggle.com/code/luisdsuarez/titanic-first-approach).
